# About
This is the repository which includes fan-made voxels for Outlaws game. The voxels are meant to be used in The Force Engine (https://theforceengine.github.io/).

# Installation

The Force Engine doesn't support voxels at the moment. It is unknown when voxel support will be fully implemented but for now it's planned for 2024. Moreover TFE doesn't support Outlaws game yet.
